## Extras

### Terminal Font

I'm using [`CaskaydiaMono Nerd Font`](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.3.0/CascadiaMono.zip) with full icon support (great for powerlines and Oh My Posh prompts). If you prefer not to download the zip here, visit this website and search for it there: (https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)

> Download the `.zip`, extract it, install the font on your system, and set this in your 'settings.json':
>
> ```json
> "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "CaskaydiaMono Nerd Font"
> ```

### Editor Font

For the editor, I am using [`FiraCode Nerd Font`](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.3.0/FiraCode.zip) â€” it's an extension of Fira Mono font. If you prefer not to download the zip here, visit this website and search for it there: (https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)

> Download the `.zip`, extract it, install the font, and set this in your `settings.json`:
>
> ```json
> "editor.fontFamily": "FiraCode Nerd Font Propo, monospace"
> ```
